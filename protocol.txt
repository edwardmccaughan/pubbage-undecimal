general overview
---------------------

controllers <-> tunnel <-> screens

every controller gets assigned a unique id number when it connects.
When the controller sends a message to the tunnel, the tunnel passes it along to the screens with an id of who it was from.
screens are all equal, messages from controllers get sent to all screens

Messages are _ delimited, where the first parameter generally being the command/message type and the second being the id of who it is for/from

messages
-------------------------

The screen receives from the tunnel:

new_0
	new player has connected, with an id of 0
	sent as soon as the player socket connects
p_1_u
	player id 0 has send the message "u"

screen can send messages to players via the tunnel:

p_0_something
	sends player id 0 the message "something"
p_a_something
	sends all players the message "something"
	
messages to player controllers are usually stripped of the preceding "p_1_" as they are sent, so they can generally process it straight away
